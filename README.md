# Better Platform and Practice Buttons Config UI
Geometry Dash is a good game but our Platformer & Practice buttons config UI should be better, it's terribly hard to get their logic of settings and it actually have tons of weird designs and bugs like:
- No position inputer for buttons;
- In Platformer buttons UI, snap and split options look like nonsense;
- In Platformer buttons UI, if you have save or load a dpad layout slot, the six buttons will turn not available until you close the UI menu and launch it again, also we cannot read the data from the three save slots firstly, let alone getting a brief preview;
- In Practice buttons UI, the opacity inputer and slider does not return to 1.00 on reset button clicked.
- If we transport our savefile (or save load?) between devices of different screen ratio, our carefully designed UI will definitely break or even go outside of the screen.
  
I'm not sure it's worthy or not (for it has been 20 months since 2.2 and most of us should seldom access the two menus?)  
But anyway it's already here.
  
### <cy>Note that:</c>
I can't get where RobTop's snap and split option toggler (in the Platform buttons config UI) actually take effects smh, but in case it really does something, each of the two options is preserved as a text label button for each and is linked with RobTop's original toggler callback.  
Welcome to share with me if you have an idea on the options.
