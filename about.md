# Better Platform and Practice Buttons Config UI
Geometry Dash is a good game but RobTop's Platformer & Practice buttons config UI looks weird (and ugly?), it's terribly hard to get his logic of settings and it actually have tons of weird designs and bugs like:
- No position inputer for buttons;
- In Platformer buttons UI, snap and split options looks like nonsense;
- In Platformer buttons UI, if you have save or load a dpad layout slot, the six buttons will turn not available until you close the UI menu and call it again, also we cannot get the data of the three save slots, let alone getting a brief preview;
- In Practice buttons UI, the opacity inputer and slider does not return to 1.00 on reset button clicked.
- If we transport our savefile (or save load?) between devices of different screen ratio, our carefully designed UI will definitely break or even go outside of the screen.

I get boring writing Chroma Icons and playing Celeste Strawberry Jam ~~(getting rekt by Starfruit Supernova goldberry)~~ these days so I spent a week to write this new mod. I'm not sure it's worthy or not (for it has been 20 months since 2.2 and most of us should seldom access the two menus?) 

But anyway it's already here.

The options button in this UI is preserved for future update, I know it being there for the only transparency option is a little funny.
