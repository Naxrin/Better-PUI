# Better Platformer & Practice Config UI
Geometry Dash is a good game but our Platformer & Practice buttons config UI can be better. The current UI actually have tons of shit designs and bugs like:
- No position inputer for buttons;
- In Platformer buttons UI, snap and split options looks like nonsense;
- In Platformer buttons UI, if you have save or load a dpad layout slot, the six buttons will turn not available until you close the UI menu and call it again, also we cannot get the data of the three save slots, let alone getting a brief preview;
- In Practice buttons UI, the opacity inputer and slider does not return to 1.00 on reset button clicked.
- If we transport our savefile (or save load?) between devices of different screen ratio, our carefully designed UI will definitely break or even go outside of the screen.

I get boring writing Chroma Icons and playing Celeste Strawberry Jam ~~(getting rekt by Starfruit Supernova goldberry)~~ these days so I spent a week to write this new mod. I'm not sure it's worthy or not (for it has been 20 months since 2.2 and most of us should seldom access the two menus?) 

But anyway it's already here.
